# PCA-KernelPCA
Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.


## Persian News Classification 

### our Dataset consists of Persian news in 10 categories. Formerly we created SVC model on this dataset and we got 0.83 accuracy. check it [here](https://github.com/kiyan-rezaee/Persian-News-Classificaion)

now we want to reduce dimension with kernel PCA, use SVC model and check the result.

>>> 60814 features ---> 100 features

### Result = accuracy : 0.84!!
